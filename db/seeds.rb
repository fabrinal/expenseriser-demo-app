# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Expense.create(date: "2015-01-01", amount: 10, ex_type_id: 1)
# Expense.create(date: "2015-01-01", amount: 20, ex_type_id: 1)
# Expense.create(date: "2015-01-01", amount: 5, ex_type_id: 2)
# Expense.create(date: "2015-01-01", amount: 15, ex_type_id: 2)
